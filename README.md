# Digital Clock Project
A simple, responsive digital clock web app with dark/light mode, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Problem Statement
Many people need a simple, easy-to-read clock that not only shows the current time but also displays the date and day. Additionally, a visually appealing design with dark/light mode makes it more user-friendly.

## Solution
The task is to create a **Digital Clock** using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** that updates every second and includes optional features like animations and theme toggle.
This project implements a digital clock that shows:

## Features
- Real-time **time** in 12-hour format with AM/PM  
- Current **date** (DD-MM-YYYY)  
- **Day of the week** (Sunday to Saturday)  
- **Dark/Light mode toggle** for better user experience  
- **Simple animations** for visual appeal  
- **Responsive design** for mobile devices 
- No external libraries or frameworks

## How to Run
1. Download the repository or clone it from GitHub.  
2. Open `index.html` in any modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).  
3. The clock will automatically display the current time, date, and day.  
4. Click the **Switch to Light/Dark Mode** button to change the theme.  

## Extra Features Implemented
- **Animations:** Smooth pulse and fade-in effects for clock and date.  
- **Dark/Light Mode:** Toggle button to switch themes.  
- **Responsive Design:** Adjusts for smaller screens and mobile devices.
